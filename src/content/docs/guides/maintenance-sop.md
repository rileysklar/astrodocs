### 1. Change All Your WordPress Passwords

![Change all your passwords regularly](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/7w2CQK9IRwrVihC4vk-O7wubCKHRjbeTLebVNZ94VREB9kXRgpdXMb2dz-1aizP0-iwx0TltFXwyrjfwiP29JowXQt6w-VzwmhvFmh_2AvCEi1oVeIbIsCNZdm2Qc4r1Wg87U7C20oZqJIIQOXnhMvU)

Passwords are your first defense against unauthorized access to your website. You should always use strong unique passwords for all your online accounts. These include your WordPress website, FTP accounts, and database.

However, even if you are using strong passwords, they could be compromised without you even knowing.

That's why WordPress security experts recommend changing your WordPress passwords regularly. This includes passwords for your [WordPress admin area](https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-tutorials/11-vital-tips-and-hacks-to-protect-your-wordpress-admin-area/), FTP or SSH accounts, and your WordPress database password.

For more help, check out our beginner's guide to [changing your password in WordPress](https://www.wpbeginner.com/beginners-guide/how-to-change-your-password-in-wordpress/).

The problem with strong passwords is that they are harder to remember. This is why we recommend using password manager apps like [LastPass](https://www.wpbeginner.com/refer/lastpass/) to securely store and easily fill passwords without having to type them.

For details, see our guide on the [best ways to manage WordPress passwords](https://www.wpbeginner.com/beginners-guide/what-is-the-best-way-to-manage-passwords-for-wordpress-beginners/).

### 2. Create a Complete Backup of Your Website

![Create manual backup](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-PyNUeDSsnoEKHwkKijO-h3vinzWNk3c3Z2oeqBT25ImnRV_OUp_eei-ABlNTQopjDLtUf3cuqe7-fENTUW7CjfgnTDlREU6cYYCPrWvDvDjmQRQcwrRYoXNJmRctsgKvJKA6XuGEFbz_ybgczNfC6Q)

Backups are one of the most [important WordPress plugins](https://www.wpbeginner.com/showcase/7-best-wordpress-backup-plugins-compared-pros-and-cons/). They are your first and last defense against any [WordPress disaster](https://www.wpbeginner.com/beginners-guide/wordpress-security/).

If anything goes wrong, you can quickly [restore your website](https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-tutorials/how-to-restore-wordpress-from-backup-step-by-step/). This includes hacked WordPress sites, broken WordPress installations, or even if you want to [move WordPress](https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-tutorials/how-to-move-wordpress-to-a-new-host-or-server-with-no-downtime/) to a different server.

We recommend using a [complete WordPress backup solution](https://www.wpbeginner.com/beginners-guide/what-is-a-wordpress-backup-and-why-you-need-backup/). This includes both database and all WordPress files.

You can use a WordPress backup plugin to create and store backups off-site. There are several [great WordPress backup plugins](https://www.wpbeginner.com/showcase/7-best-wordpress-backup-plugins-compared-pros-and-cons/) available with different schedules and backup options.

### 3. Check and Update All WordPress Files

![Check and update WordPress files](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/XNBGKWDeGO2sXNjD1x2Af4Wl7IJqG2aQI5OTExP-Z7KxP-B2Ue9hGKNgIzQSoi2R6SoR9Eq7WemXg0cql3KfKQXGUSLP5_j9MjTE12KVfgY-M0-RJZoEADwrruK6tKNUuhzcvJpDtfS4JNhvFtXJMEw)

WordPress regularly releases updates to fix bugs, improve performance, and add new features. These updates include WordPress core updates, theme updates, and plugin updates.

It's important to keep your WordPress site updated to the latest version to ensure [security and stability](https://www.wpbeginner.com/beginners-guide/why-you-should-keep-wordpress-updated-at-all-times/). Outdated versions are more susceptible to security vulnerabilities that hackers can exploit.

To check for updates, log in to your WordPress admin area and go to the Dashboard Â» Updates page. Here, you can see if there are any updates available for WordPress core, themes, or plugins. Simply click the "Update Now" button to apply the updates.

Before updating, it's a good practice to [create a backup](https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-tutorials/how-to-create-a-complete-wordpress-backup-for-free-without-downtime/) of your website to avoid any potential issues during the update process.

### 4. Check and Delete Spam Comments

![Delete spam comments](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/7-WUWddk3Z-nbALzBkMAs_hLmCIzZ-m3rEPLcygYs9ZBrsEMXuEShEnfxHXxVegj_mzfsACs3fhB4-dsNnZZ1P49pJss7qlCMYGGFyZz5zCQXaHv0Z0HLKNNK9DePlRXPYKFrFb9UBh8UQlv2ayjLsIg)

If you allow comments on your WordPress site, then you're likely to receive spam comments. These comments can clutter your website, slow down your site's performance, and affect your site's reputation.

To combat spam, you should [install and configure an anti-spam plugin](https://www.wpbeginner.com/plugins/how-to-block-spam-comments-in-wordpress-with-antispam-bee/). Some popular options include [Akismet](https://www.wpbeginner.com/refer/akismet/) and [Antispam Bee](https://www.wpbeginner.com/refer/antispam-bee/). These plugins will automatically detect and mark spam comments, preventing them from appearing on your site.

It's also a good practice to regularly go through your comments section and manually delete any spam comments that may have slipped through. Keep an eye out for comments with suspicious links, unrelated content, or generic messages.

### 5. Test All Your WordPress Forms

![Test WordPress forms](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/dV07MSk7IvItgFeKejPpW0-Lf7v3oCgOPQwA2WUNpGp26ciP2f07XnL6At8JF2wxkAcm2LUYXlafal7hB-xpveA1MN0QUb9mM2bU67cOpeZSNjyCLptQeR0nqR8KfrBRYLd4q5IGl7TbwcaDAv7yTHw)

Forms are a crucial part of most WordPress websites. Whether you're using [contact forms](https://www.wpbeginner.com/refer/wpforms/) or [e-commerce forms](https://www.wpbeginner.com/refer/woocommerce/), it's important to regularly test them to ensure they are functioning correctly.

Here are some key checks you should perform:

- **Submission Test**: Fill out and submit each form on your website to make sure submissions are received as expected.

- **Email Notifications**: If your forms send email notifications, check that you receive these emails in your inbox.

- **Error Handling**: Test the error messages and validation rules to ensure they work correctly when users submit incomplete or incorrect information.

- **Conditional Logic**: If you're using conditional logic in your forms, verify that it functions as intended.

- **Integration Tests**: If your forms integrate with third-party services (e.g., email marketing platforms), check that the integrations are working as expected.

By regularly testing your forms, you can identify and fix any issues that may arise, ensuring a smooth user experience on your site.

### 6. Optimize Your WordPress Database

![Optimize WordPress database](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/hnU0juj-URDU5fdtOw-lq7cy-Dgo6Xh_5LqKSYcaM4Vp4iStk23zmQ2UnVjPhmk8GRx0HdfRYoU7EezZlPqihDJowg2Uhq4T89EZe0XuTteJ_2wQ6P2lgLW-XkXK3FnJucvj4hblvDWd9z6POO1ZyEg)

As you use your WordPress site, your database can accumulate unnecessary data, such as revisions, trashed posts, spam comments, and more. This can lead to increased database size and slower website performance.

Optimizing your WordPress database involves cleaning up and optimizing its tables to improve site speed and efficiency. You can use plugins like [WP-Optimize](https://www.wpbeginner.com/refer/wp-optimize/) or [WP-Sweep](https://www.wpbeginner.com/refer/wp-sweep/) to automate this process.

Key optimization tasks include:

- **Cleaning Revisions**: Remove old post revisions to reduce the size of your database.

- **Clearing Spam and Trash**: Delete spam comments, trashed posts, and other unnecessary items.

- **Optimizing Tables**: Defragment and optimize database tables to improve performance.

Regularly optimizing your database can help maintain a lean and efficient website.

### 7. Review and Update Website Content

![Review and update content](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/uBfNFvMh-WAhBIDbPzXYP_A8LlUKumI2qrDr3bqPzKp6Ow4ZxjRtScJYOSAaR8e-cvjWMc9qTrCkKmbIl-Adwtrkf2seTZbHeT2rpCzgEGvSJWm_Q1wmDo5XKFE9Rrkg1qI4rydB56J3jCZ2ikVU1qw)

Content is the lifeblood of your website. Regularly reviewing and updating your content is essential to keep your site relevant and engaging for your audience.

Here are some content-related tasks to consider:

- **Check for Outdated Information**: Review your pages and blog posts for outdated information or broken links. Update or remove them as needed.

- **Improve SEO**: Optimize your content for search engines by using relevant keywords, adding meta descriptions, and improving readability.

- **Add Fresh Content**: Publish new blog posts or articles to keep your site's content fresh and attract returning visitors.

- **Update Images and Media**: Ensure that images and media files are up-to-date and properly optimized for faster loading times.

- **Check for Broken Links**: Use a [broken link checker plugin](https://www.wpbeginner.com/plugins/how-to-find-and-fix-broken-links-in-wordpress/) to identify and fix broken links on your site.

- **Update Plugins**: If you use plugins for content display (e.g., social media feeds or galleries), make sure they are up-to-date and functioning correctly.

By regularly reviewing and updating your website's content, you can provide a better experience for your visitors and improve your site's search engine rankings.

### 8. Monitor Website Speed and Performance

![Monitor website speed and performance](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/ubRRKFlZBycyh9HTK4gFqwxoLqJ3-9w1Q7tjAKPEigD9E2V4ULC4nXUI1d8Aa3UuyC3sQGSuo6NT4RLWOS-WOT0Le94C10cIwX0kGArhj1Jj26Y13NR0RkzDcEK-UHZcGqYbNg1vi9cmm-mkyc00nTRw)

Website speed and performance are critical factors that influence user experience and search engine rankings. Slow-loading websites can frustrate visitors and lead to high bounce rates.

To ensure your WordPress site performs well:

- **Use a Fast Hosting Provider**: Choose a reputable hosting provider that offers fast servers and good uptime.

- **Optimize Images**: Compress and resize images to reduce their file sizes without compromising quality.

- **Implement Caching**: Use a caching plugin like [WP Super Cache](https://www.wpbeginner.com/refer/wp-super-cache/) or [W3 Total Cache](https://www.wpbeginner.com/refer/w3-total-cache/) to speed up page loading times.

- **Minify CSS and JavaScript**: Minification reduces the size of CSS and JavaScript files, improving load times.

- **Content Delivery Network (CDN)**: Consider using a CDN to distribute your website's content across multiple servers worldwide, reducing latency.

- **Regularly Monitor Performance**: Use tools like [Google PageSpeed Insights](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights) or [GTmetrix](https://gtmetrix.com/) to regularly test and analyze your site's performance.

Optimizing website speed and performance is an ongoing process, so make it a regular part of your maintenance routine.

### 9. Review and Update Website Security

![Review and update website security](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/P6i1zSJjAnzXUR1jhZf1TnBktLwi7dp3ZGtWdbnL41_fRpHZPf4ebs1KCVkTKKuKi8Br3fjZfwEdj48QgRyv2Fv4RXtS-bSag7zviAte9Yz-u-5O5ea_cj9Icm2d08wOHnFzZ78dCq6u8Tbk4tQ7qPYA)

Security should always be a top priority for your WordPress site. Regularly reviewing and updating your site's security measures can help prevent hacking attempts and protect sensitive information.

Here are some security-related tasks to consider:

- **Keep Everything Updated**: Ensure that WordPress core, themes, and plugins are always up-to-date to patch security vulnerabilities.

- **Use Strong Passwords**: Encourage users to use strong, unique passwords. You can also consider implementing [two-factor authentication (2FA)](https://www.wpbeginner.com/plugins/how-to-add-two-factor-authentication-for-wordpress/).

- **Install a Security Plugin**: Use a reputable security plugin like [Sucuri](https://www.wpbeginner.com/refer/sucuri/) or [Wordfence](https://www.wpbeginner.com/refer/wordfence/) to enhance your site's security.

- **Regularly Scan for Malware**: Set up regular malware scans to detect and remove any malicious code from your site.

- **Backup Your Site**: Regularly back up your site, as mentioned earlier, to ensure you can restore it in case of a security breach.

- **Monitor User Activity**: Keep an eye on user activity and logins. Some security plugins provide this functionality.

By taking a proactive approach to security, you can reduce the risk of security breaches and maintain the trust of your visitors.

### 10. Review and Update User Roles and Permissions

![Review and update user roles and permissions](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/1dG-2XrIOZNIdSC9NdB-dP6IwU0YqXrUwih05Lh8xjd0nW1c4nVL8pzWMUvRdb7weTYC3Ev7rUVN_gkBJ3i96QNhA7B9ScudfJ2fybBx3CYZ0Q50JLhxrCnEjJuLdbEozrcw3aR0d1ZKw54LqKZIhsy4)

If your WordPress site has multiple users or contributors, it's important to regularly review and update their roles and permissions.

Here are some key considerations:

- **Remove Unused Accounts**: If there are user accounts that are no longer needed, delete or disable them.

- **Review User Roles**: Ensure that each user has an appropriate role with the right level of access. Limit administrative access to trusted users only.

- **Update Passwords**: Encourage all users to update their passwords regularly.

- **Audit User Activity**: Use plugins or tools to audit user activity, especially for administrative users, to detect any suspicious actions.

By managing user roles and permissions effectively, you can minimize the risk of unauthorized access and maintain control over your website.

### 11. Perform Regular Backups

![Perform regular backups](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/VaKGvOqD6gSmzG_1qu0z1YDGv8PkcMYw17T3JTpO6Wx2oURafC0Mj-Lbc3RkJdRbDNPh1WXa-fMmDX7cnRhwbr9kHPdyxH2vLkgH4PmXeoygs-Ek-VeplLXe1OJAF_qD3h98krZ5S3BdCubHlk2UxMA)

Regular backups are your safety net in case something goes wrong with your website. They allow you to restore your site to a previous working state quickly.

Here are some backup-related tasks to consider:

- **Automate Backups**: Set up automated backups on a regular schedule, such as daily or weekly, depending on your website's activity.

- **Store Backups Off-Site**: Store backups in a remote location, such as cloud storage or an external server, to prevent data loss in case of server failure.

- **Test Restores**: Periodically test the restoration process to ensure that your backups are functional.

- **Retain Multiple Backups**: Keep multiple backup copies, including older versions, to provide a range of restore points.

- **Secure Backup Access**: Restrict access to backup files to authorized users only.

By maintaining regular backups, you can quickly recover from unexpected events, such as hacking, data corruption, or accidental changes.

### 12. Monitor Website Uptime

![Monitor website uptime](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/NrvO7PVII-vYltQcGRoU9aVd7ksXNv88snRAQNUBMLDe5gAPxx1YVtZZeaTIFJ7s-6P1mr2GHR8jcFcsUwqCpeArBNH6HAPcrVciyN02eAznyR2lHwHj0X81sIM5EgihBbfDdcmRrQnCj0SBxdXg-OA)

Website uptime is critical for user experience and search engine rankings. Downtime can result in lost visitors and revenue.

To monitor website uptime:

- **Use Uptime Monitoring Services**: Subscribe to a reliable uptime monitoring service that regularly checks your website's availability. Some services offer free plans.

- **Set Up Alerts**: Configure alerts to notify you immediately if your site goes down.

- **Investigate Downtime**: If downtime occurs, investigate the cause and take steps to resolve it promptly.

Regular monitoring ensures that you can address downtime issues quickly and minimize disruption to your website visitors.

### 13. Plan for Scaling and Growth

![Plan for scaling and growth](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/vvFpBQO0FfFO4HOkHWeerxOGi8LoOZDLpTsvl5SLsJ9YCHvCr5xrQQyB6b6QISu_q3kTm1K2gYCTldNGH0rKukS23mz_QPFlnKGR2V6jGW-NkT4GYqZh7iXpYFZff7sP7g4EGBRBdY6_eDNzjYX2vYg)

As your website grows, it's important to plan for scalability and accommodate increased traffic and content.

Consider these steps:

- **Optimize Hosting**: If your site experiences growth, consider upgrading your hosting plan to handle increased traffic and resources.

- **Content Strategy**: Plan your content strategy for the future, including the creation of new content and the maintenance of existing content.

- **Performance Optimization**: Continue to optimize your site's performance to handle increased traffic efficiently.

- **Security Scaling**: Ensure that your security measures can scale with your website growth to protect against evolving threats.

Planning for scalability and growth is crucial to accommodate increased demand and ensure a smooth user experience.

By regularly performing these maintenance tasks, you can keep your WordPress website secure, fast, and up-to-date while providing an excellent user experience for your visitors. Remember that website maintenance is an ongoing process, and staying proactive is key to a successful WordPress website.

When a user requests a page that doesn't exist on your website, then WordPress will show them a [404 error page](https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-tutorials/how-to-fix-wordpress-posts-returning-404-error/).

404 errors that occur because a user mistyped an address are normal and nothing to be worried about. However, 404 errors that occur because a page is no longer available are frustrating for users and create a bad user experience.

If you are not already tracking 404 error pages, then see our guide on how to easily [track 404 error pages in WordPress and redirect them](https://www.wpbeginner.com/plugins/how-to-track-404-pages-and-redirect-them-in-wordpress/).

### 9. Find and Fix Broken Links

![Find and fix broken links in WordPress](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/0DVZ1Sx_JPZH79BnXe1kdnE5ZqCPcZY4crhAOn8WT40kacShoAgydZDpNDtg36g5KM158UH-g7pb-48G24NMCv-puYkADJeD0G_kr_aNRW_o-qZp25cIvga-xoR7qU7TyrsbZyh2RfVQv45jMYdDPdo)

As your website grows, you will realize that some external websites that you linked to in your older articles do not exist anymore. Some may have moved to new locations, while others may just disappear.

The broken links issue is not just limited to external links. You might accidentally add broken images, poorly formatted links, or misspell your own links. This can be frustrating for your visitors and harms your site's [user engagement](https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-tutorials/how-to-track-user-engagement-in-wordpress-with-google-analytics/).

You need to check your website for broken links as part of your WordPress maintenance routine. For instructions, see our guide on how to [find and fix broken links in WordPress](https://www.wpbeginner.com/plugins/how-to-fix-broken-links-in-wordpress-with-broken-link-checker/).

### 10. Perform a Thorough Content and SEO Audit

The next thing you need to include in your regular maintenance tasks is a thorough in-depth review of your content. This is where the data from [Google Search Console](https://www.wpbeginner.com/beginners-guide/how-to-add-your-wordpress-site-to-google-webmaster-tools/) and [Google Analytics](https://www.wpbeginner.com/beginners-guide/how-to-install-google-analytics-in-wordpress/) comes in.

Google Analytics shows you where your visitors are coming from and what they are doing on your website. This data allows you to discover content on your website where you have lots of traffic but your [conversion rate](https://www.wpbeginner.com/beginners-guide/wordpress-conversion-tracking-made-simple-a-step-by-step-guide/) is low.

Google Search Console's Search Performance page can help you find search keywords where your site appears in the results. You can sort it to show you keywords where your site can easily rank higher by updating those articles.

If you are using [All in One SEO](https://aioseo.com/), then you can set a particular keyword as your focus keyphrase. All in One SEO will give you a True SEO Score plus specific optimization tips.

Even with an excellent SEO score, you can still further improve your content. Try adding new information, adding images, and linking to it from other pages on your website.

For more SEO tips, follow our ultimate step-by-step [WordPress SEO guide](https://www.wpbeginner.com/wordpress-seo/) for beginners.

**Pro Tip:** You can use a tool like [SEMRush](https://www.wpbeginner.com/refer/semrush/) to run automatic website audits. This is what we use on WPBeginner.

### 11. Optimize Images on Your WordPress Site

![Optimize images and media library](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/NrPNym00tzk0fOGqcE2xJnhRyWpe63nC06-z59dZd3g0I0nhep-dnXJUsK8LyFLYfbId26Z2jh1UmvzfFiBIu24Z7GXQMLAAU-ADLPI5JX_3_ngvWbG0NpkPGm93K9JdsQUYlGNxH8idCS-8o8HMcZo)

Images take longer to load than text. This means they decrease your page load speed. You will discover some overly large images during the performance checkup of your site.

However, you will likely miss those in your less popular articles. If you run a [multi-author WordPress site](https://www.wpbeginner.com/plugins/21-great-plugins-to-manage-multi-author-blogs-efficiently-and-successfully/), then some of your authors may not be as careful about image sizes as you are.

Reviewing your images and media library allows you to stay on top of the issue. You can perform this check to find images that can be reduced in size or images that are just too large.

For more information, see our guide on [how to save images optimized for the Web](https://www.wpbeginner.com/beginners-guide/speed-wordpress-save-images-optimized-web/).

### 12. Review WordPress Security Logs

![WordPress security review](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/M7VL7xT3r_GlRvUG30h5IscFQiQsoLE4PFiKTHgGblN_hRB4kxDBirCI51RIMxr3f_qFTSAIIiVJIVXTqS4M2B5JhkYzukgREBhJZhHD24hQ5CEPC0kHJev2sG2scwxvknsxiALTdLN4PYJRe7ruBUA)

Some WordPress users don't realize that their site is under attack until it slows down or their search rankings drop.

We have already mentioned some security precautions like changing passwords and creating manual backups as proactive measures. You also need to review your site's access and error logs to see if there is any unusual activity on your site.

Another good option is to add a [security audit](https://www.wpbeginner.com/plugins/how-to-monitor-user-activity-in-wordpress-with-simple-history/) plugin to your site.

We also recommend using [Sucuri](https://www.wpbeginner.com/refer/sucuri/). It is a website security company that offers a website firewall to protect your website against common threats.

For a complete security audit of your WordPress site, follow the instructions in our step-by-step [ultimate WordPress security guide](https://www.wpbeginner.com/wordpress-security/).

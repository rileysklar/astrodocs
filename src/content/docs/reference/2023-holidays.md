## Employee PTO Submission

For our employees, please submit your expected PTO to your supervisor for approval as soon as possible so that we can get the dates in the calendar. Keep in mind that unused PTO does not carry forward to the next year. If you are unsure of the PTO available to you, please come see me, and we will figure that out.

## Contractor Availability

For our regular contractors, if you don't mind, please let me know when you will not be available (other than our office closure dates), so that we can put that in the Shakewell calendar and we don't bother you while on vacation.

## Return to Work

## On-Call Explanation

What does "on-call" mean? Over the holidays, we like the team to be able to enjoy some downtime, although, that being said, we still need to take care of any client or co-worker needs that may pop up. This doesn't mean you need to work 8 hours a day, but it does mean you need to be checking your email/slack regularly to make sure there aren't any fires to put out, client needs, or staff requests/needs, etc. It's typically pretty quiet, but our clients and our co-workers may have requests, so just make sure you don't leave anyone hanging. If you do not want to be on-call those days, please request PTO.
